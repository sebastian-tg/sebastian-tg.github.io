        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>I am an astrophysicist and computational scientist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
          <a href="https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/institutes/ari/" title="Zentrum für Astronomie">Zentrum für Astronomie</a> 
          at Heidelberg University. My research centers on linking baryons (ordinary matter) and dark matter in the context 
          of galaxy formation to understand both how galaxies form, and how to exploit them as probes of cosmology and 
          the particle nature of dark matter. My long-term goal is to develop models of tracer populations 
          (including stars, star clusters, and neutral hydrogen) to reconstruct the formation and assembly of galaxies and
          their host dark matter haloes using the next-generation surveys and the latest advances in machine intelligence.</p> 
          
         <p>As a member of the Galaxy Evolution research group, I investigate how galaxies shape the properties of their 
          star cluster populations, and how the most massive and ancient clusters (known as globular clusters) can be used to
          learn about the assembly of galaxies and their dark matter haloes. I am involved in the 
          <a href="https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~astjpfef/e-mosaics/" title="E-MOSAICS project">E-MOSAICS project</a>, 
          which has produced the first hydrodynamical simulation to follow the formation and evolution of star clusters and their 
          host galaxies to the present day in a representative cosmological volume constaining thousands of galaxies.
          I am also working on the next generation of simulations of galaxies and their star clusters using 
          improved physical models for star and cluster formation, and stellar feedback as part of the EMP (Empirically Motivated Physics) team.</p>
        
        <p>I dedicate a significant fraction of my research to learning about the latest advances in machine learning, and applying them
          to the most challenging problems in cosmology and galaxy formation. I have developed interpretable deep learning models to 
          reconstruct the assembly histories of galaxies in large surveys from simple observables. I am currently investigating the use of 
          deep learning, and in particular convolutional neural networks, to recover the halo mass function from neutral hydrogen surveys and
          use it to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales.<\p>
