        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>I am an astrophysicist and computational scientist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
          <a href="https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/institutes/ari/" title="Zentrum für Astronomie">Zentrum für Astronomie</a> 
          at Heidelberg University. My research centers on linking baryons (ordinary matter) and dark matter in the context 
          of galaxy formation to understand both how galaxies form, and how to exploit them as probes of cosmology and 
          the particle nature of dark matter. My long-term goal is to develop models of tracer populations 
          (including stars, star clusters, and neutral hydrogen) to reconstruct the formation and assembly of galaxies and
          their host dark matter haloes using the next-generation surveys and the latest advances in machine intelligence.</p> 
          
         <p>As a member of the Galaxy Evolution research group, I investigate how galaxies shape the properties of their 
          star cluster populations, and how the most massive and ancient clusters (known as globular clusters) can be used to
          learn about the assembly of galaxies and their dark matter haloes. I am involved in the 
          <a href="https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~astjpfef/e-mosaics/" title="">E-MOSAICS project</a>, 
          which has produced the first hydrodynamical simulation to follow the formation and evolution of star clusters and their 
          host galaxies to the present day in a representative cosmological volume constaining thousands of galaxies.
          I am also working on the next generation of simulations of galaxies and their star clusters using 
          improved physical models for star and cluster formation, and stellar feedback as part of the EMP (Empirically Motivated Physics) team.</p>
        
        <h3>Reconstructing the assembly of galaxies using star clusters</h3>
        
        <p>I dedicate a significant fraction of my research to learning about the latest advances in machine learning, and applying them
          to the most challenging problems in cosmology and galaxy formation. I have developed interpretable deep learning models to 
          reconstruct the assembly histories of galaxies in large surveys from simple observables. The figure below shows the predictions of an artificial neural network classifier trained to infer the origin (in-situ vs. accreted) 
          of globular clusters in large galaxy surveys (from <i>Trujillo-Gomez et al. submitted</i>). The model was trained using over 700 simulated galaxies from the 
           <a href="https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~astjpfef/e-mosaics/" title="E-MOSAICS project">E-MOSAICS project</a> 
           and their merger trees. The left panel shows the previously known origin of each of the Milky Way clusters, and the 
           middle panel shows the predictions of the neural network when the system is observed in projection 
           like an external galaxy. With only a few simple observables (positions, line-of-sight velocities, iron abundances), the network accurately
           predicts the origin of up to 90 percent of clusters with unambiguous labels. It also correctly identifies at least 80 percent of the clusters
           accreted from the <i>Kraken</i> and <i>Gaia-Enceladus</i> progenitors. This represents a successful first step on the road to 
           reconstructing the assembly of observed galaxies using surveys.</p>

        <h3>Measuring the abundance of dark matter haloes to understand the nature of dark matter</h3>
       
        <p>I am currently investigating the use of 
          deep learning, and in particular convolutional neural networks, to recover the halo mass function from neutral hydrogen surveys and
          use it to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. The image below shows a comparison of the best observational estimate 
          of the dark matter halo mass function currently available (using the maximum circular velocity as a proxy) with the predictions of
          the concordance cosmological model, &Lambda;CDM (figure from 
          <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.4825T/abstract" title=""><i>Trujillo-Gomez et al. 2018</i></a>). 
          After carefully accounting for the effects of radiation, stellar feedack, and systematics in the dynamical models, we found that 
          low-mass haloes still appear to be underabundant compared to the predictions. This discrepancy could provide important hints on the 
          elusive particle nature of dark matter, indicating that it may not be cold or collisionless
          (see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470.1542S/abstract" title=""><i>Schneider, Trujillo-Gomez et al. 2017</i></a>).</p>
